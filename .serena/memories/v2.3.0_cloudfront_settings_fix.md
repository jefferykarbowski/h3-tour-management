# v2.3.0 CloudFront Settings Fix

## Issue
User reported that the CloudFront CDN settings section was not appearing in the admin UI after v2.3.0 release.

## Root Cause
1. The `admin/s3-settings.php` file had dependencies on non-existent `H3TM_S3_Integration` class
2. The `H3TM_S3_Settings` class was not being instantiated in the main plugin's init function

## Fix Applied
1. **Updated admin/s3-settings.php**:
   - Fixed `test_s3_connection()` method to use `H3TM_S3_Simple` instead of non-existent `H3TM_S3_Integration`
   - Fixed `manual_cleanup()` method to check if `H3TM_S3_Processor` exists before using it
   - Removed all references to `$this->s3_integration`

2. **Updated h3-tour-management.php**:
   - Added `new H3TM_S3_Settings();` to the `h3tm_init()` function to properly initialize the settings page

## CloudFront Settings Available
After this fix, the following CloudFront settings are now accessible in the admin UI:
- Enable/Disable CloudFront toggle
- CloudFront Domain input (e.g., d1234567890abc.cloudfront.net)
- Distribution ID input (for cache invalidation)

## Files Modified
- `admin/s3-settings.php` - Fixed broken class dependencies
- `h3-tour-management.php` - Added H3TM_S3_Settings instantiation

## Testing
- PHP syntax validation passed for both files
- Settings registration confirmed in code
- CloudFront settings section properly rendered in admin UI HTML
