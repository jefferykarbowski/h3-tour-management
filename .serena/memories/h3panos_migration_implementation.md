# H3panos Tours to S3 Migration Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented the "Migrate to S3" button functionality in the admin interface for migrating tours from the h3panos folder to S3.

## Implementation Details

### 1. AJAX Handler Added (class-h3tm-admin.php)
- Added `handle_migrate_tour_to_s3` method at line 1757
- Handles both directory-based tours and ZIP files
- Checks multiple possible h3panos locations:
  - C:/Users/Jeff/Local Sites/h3vt/app/public/h3panos
  - Various ABSPATH relative locations
  - Both h3panos and h3-tours directory names

### 2. S3 Upload Method Added (class-h3tm-s3-simple.php)
- Added public `upload_file` method at line 861
- Supports direct file upload to S3 using presigned URLs
- Auto-detects content types for proper MIME handling
- Returns success/failure status with logging

### 3. Features Implemented
- Space-to-dash conversion (matching Lambda behavior)
- Duplicate detection to prevent re-uploading existing tours
- ZIP file extraction and upload support
- Progress tracking (files uploaded, bytes transferred)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Tours Ready for Migration
Located in C:/Users/Jeff/Local Sites/h3vt/app/public/h3panos/:
- Arden-FairOaks
- Arden-Farmington
- Arden-Geneva
- Arden-Palm Harbor
- Auberge-Plano

## Usage
1. Navigate to WordPress Admin â†’ 3D Tours
2. In the "Existing Tours" section, local tours will show with a "Migrate to S3" button
3. Click the button to migrate the tour to S3
4. The tour will be uploaded with proper naming conversion (spaces to dashes)
5. Once migrated, the tour will appear in the S3 tours list

## Next Steps
- Test the migration with one of the tours
- Verify the migrated tour displays correctly via the tour URL handler
- Consider batch migration option for all tours at once
