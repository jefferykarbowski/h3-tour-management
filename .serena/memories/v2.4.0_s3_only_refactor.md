# v2.4.0 S3-Only Refactoring

## Major Changes
Complete removal of local tour functionality - system now operates exclusively with S3/CloudFront delivery.

## What Was Removed
1. **Local Tour Storage**: 
   - Removed all local h3panos directory handling
   - Removed local tour upload functionality
   - Removed local-to-S3 migration features

2. **UI/UX Changes**:
   - Removed upload form from main admin page
   - Removed "Local Tours" section
   - Removed storage location references (S3, Cloud Storage, Local, etc.)
   - Simplified tour listing to show only "Available" status

3. **Code Simplification**:
   - H3TM_Tour_Manager class now only provides deprecated stubs
   - get_all_tours_by_source() now only returns S3 tours
   - get_s3_tours() simplified to only query S3

4. **JavaScript Updates**:
   - Removed migration button handlers
   - Removed S3/Local distinction in UI
   - Cleaned up messaging to not mention storage locations

## Files Modified
- **h3-tour-management.php**: Updated version to 2.4.0, changed description
- **includes/class-h3tm-admin.php**: Simplified render_main_page(), removed local tour handling
- **includes/class-h3tm-tour-manager.php**: Replaced with minimal S3-only version
- **assets/js/admin.js**: Removed storage references and migration functionality

## Benefits
- Cleaner codebase with single storage strategy
- Improved performance via CloudFront CDN
- Reduced complexity and maintenance burden
- Better user experience without storage confusion

## Tour Access
All tours are now accessed through:
- Primary: CloudFront CDN (if configured)
- Fallback: Direct S3 URLs
- URL Pattern: /h3panos/[tour-name]/ (handled by S3 proxy)
