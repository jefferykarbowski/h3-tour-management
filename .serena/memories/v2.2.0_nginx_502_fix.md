# H3 Tour Management v2.2.0 - Nginx 502 Fix

## Release Date
September 28, 2025

## Problem
Nginx 502 Bad Gateway errors when accessing S3 tour URLs on Pantheon (e.g., https://h3vt.com/h3panos/Cedar%20Park).

## Root Cause
1. WordPress rewrite rules don't work properly with nginx without special configuration
2. `exit()` calls in PHP code cause nginx to return 502 errors on Pantheon
3. HEAD requests were not properly handled

## Solution

### 1. Pantheon-Specific Early Handler
Added `pantheon_early_tour_handler()` that:
- Catches h3panos requests before WordPress fully processes them
- Parses URLs directly when rewrite rules fail
- Uses PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT constant to detect Pantheon hosting

### 2. Removed exit() Calls
- Replaced all `exit()` with `wp_die()` or `die()`
- Added proper wp_die_handler filters
- Ensures WordPress completes its execution cycle

### 3. HEAD Request Support
- Added detection for HEAD requests
- Uses wp_remote_head() for efficiency
- Returns only headers without body content

### 4. Output Buffer Management
- Clear all output buffers before serving content
- Prevents conflicts with other plugins/themes

## Files Modified
- `includes/class-h3tm-s3-proxy.php` - Main fixes for nginx compatibility
- `h3-tour-management.php` - Version bump to 2.2.0

## Testing
- HEAD requests now return 200 instead of 502
- GET requests serve tour content properly
- URLs like /h3panos/Cedar%20Park/ work on Pantheon

## Key Changes in class-h3tm-s3-proxy.php

```php
// Pantheon detection and early handler
if (defined('PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT')) {
    add_action('init', array($this, 'pantheon_early_tour_handler'), 999);
}

// HEAD request handling
$is_head_request = ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] ?? '') === 'HEAD';
if ($is_head_request) {
    $response = wp_remote_head($s3_url, ...);
    // Send only headers, no body
    return;
}

// Replace exit() with wp_die()
wp_die('', '', array('response' => 200));
```
