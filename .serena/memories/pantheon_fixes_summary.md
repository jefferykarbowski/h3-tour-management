# Pantheon Environment Fixes

## Issue 1: S3 Tours Not Loading (Spinner Forever)
**Problem**: The "Loading S3 tours..." spinner would spin indefinitely on Pantheon.

**Root Causes**:
1. S3 API timeout due to pagination with 1000+ files
2. Default 10-second timeout too short for Pantheon's network latency
3. No error feedback when AJAX calls failed

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Increased S3 API timeout from 10s to 30s
- Added 5-minute transient caching for S3 tour list
- Implemented fallback to database records on timeout
- Enhanced JavaScript error handling with retry button
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

## Issue 2: Showing 116 Tours Instead of 4
**Problem**: Pantheon showed "116 tours in S3 cloud storage" when only 4 tours exist in S3.

**Root Cause**: 
The `handle_list_s3_tours()` AJAX handler was incorrectly combining:
- 112 local tours from h3panos directory
- 4 actual S3 tours
- Returning all 116 as "S3 tours"

**Solution**:
- Modified handler to return ONLY S3 tours
- Removed local tour scanning from the method
- Eliminated duplicate checking (not needed)
- Renamed variables for clarity

## Key Files Modified

### includes/class-h3tm-s3-simple.php
- `list_s3_tours()`: Added pagination, timeout handling
- `handle_list_s3_tours()`: Fixed to return only S3 tours
- Added transient caching for performance

### assets/js/admin.js  
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Console logging for debugging
- Retry button on failures
- Timeout set to 30 seconds

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clear transients after deployment**:
   ```php
   delete_transient('h3tm_s3_tours_cache');
   ```

2. **Monitor logs for**:
   - "H3TM: Using cached S3 tours list"
   - "H3TM: Successfully retrieved X tours from S3"
   - Any timeout or error messages

3. **Verify in browser console**:
   - Check for "Loading S3 tours from:" message
   - Look for "S3 tours response:" with array of 4 tours

## Performance Notes

- First load may take 10-20 seconds on Pantheon (pagination)
- Subsequent loads use 5-minute cache (instant)
- Cache automatically refreshes every 5 minutes
- Fallback to database ensures tours always visible

## CORS Configuration
Verified correct for Pantheon domains:
- https://dev-h3-tours.pantheonsite.io
- https://live-h3-tours.pantheonsite.io
- Plus production domains

## Deployment Steps
1. Pull latest code (commit e03d2a5)
2. Clear WordPress transients
3. Test S3 tours loading in admin
4. Verify only 4 tours show in S3 section
5. Check local tours show separately
