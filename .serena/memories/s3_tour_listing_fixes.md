# S3 Tour Listing Fixes - Resolved Issues

## Problem Summary
Tours weren't being displayed even though they existed in both S3 and local directories.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **S3 API Issue**: The ListObjectsV2 API with delimiter wasn't returning CommonPrefixes correctly
2. **Local Directory Issue**: Plugin was looking for h3panos directory but actual directory was h3-tours
3. **Method Name Mismatch**: getSignatureKey vs get_signing_key inconsistency

## Fixes Applied

### 1. S3 API Response Parsing (class-h3tm-s3-simple.php)
- Removed delimiter from query to get all files under tours/
- Changed parsing logic to extract tour folders from file keys instead of relying on CommonPrefixes
- Now properly extracts tours from paths like "tours/Bee-Cave/index.html"

### 2. Local Directory Discovery (class-h3tm-s3-simple.php)
- Updated to check both h3panos and h3-tours directories
- Added support for detecting ZIP files as tours
- Checks multiple possible directory locations

### 3. AWS Signature Method (class-h3tm-s3-simple.php)
- Fixed method call from get_signing_key() to getSignatureKey()
- Corrected parameter order: (secret_key, date, region, service)

### 4. Auto-Loading (admin.js)
- Removed manual refresh button
- Tours now load automatically on page load
- Added proper error handling for partial failures

## Verified Tours
- **S3 Tours**: Bee-Cave, Onion Creek, Sugar-Land
- **Local Tours**: Bee-Cave.zip in h3-tours directory

## AWS CLI Commands Used for Verification
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://h3-tour-files-h3vt/tours/
aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket h3-tour-files-h3vt --prefix tours/ --max-keys 10
```
