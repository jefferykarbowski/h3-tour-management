# Deprecated Classes Archive
**Date Archived**: 2025-10-16
**Reason**: Phase 2 cleanup - removing unused/experimental implementations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**These classes are NOT loaded by the plugin and should NOT be used in new development.**

This directory contains archived class files that were:
- Experimental/incomplete implementations
- Superseded by newer versions
- Alternative implementations that were never activated
- Dead code with no references in the active codebase

## üìã Archived Classes

### URL Handler Experiments (8 files)
Various experimental URL routing implementations:

**Note**: Main `H3TM_URL_Redirector` class is currently disabled (see h3-tour-management.php:84)
due to conflicts with S3 Proxy rewrite rules. These are alternative implementations that were never activated.

### Analytics/Utility Alternatives (4 files)

- `class-h3tm-analytics-service.php` - Analytics service layer (never instantiated)
- `class-h3tm-analytics-simple.php` - Simple analytics without Google (unused)

## üîÑ Restoration Instructions

If you need to restore any of these classes:

```bash
# Copy the file back to includes/
cp includes/deprecated/class-h3tm-CLASSNAME.php includes/

# Add require_once to h3-tour-management.php
# Add instantiation if needed
# Test thoroughly before deploying
```

## üìä Impact of Archiving

- **Files moved**: 21 PHP classes
- **Main includes/ directory**: Reduced from 50 to 29 active classes (42% reduction)
- **Breaking changes**: None - these classes were not referenced in active code
- **Rollback**: Simply move files back and add require_once statements

## üîç Verification

To verify none of these classes are used:

```bash
# From project root
cd includes/
grep -r "new H3TM_AWS_Audit" ../
grep -r "H3TM_Cleanup::" ../
grep -r "new H3TM_URL_Manager" ../
# etc... (all should return no results in active code)
```
