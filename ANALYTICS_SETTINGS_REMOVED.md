# Analytics Settings Page - REMOVED

## What Was Removed

The Analytics Settings admin page has been completely removed from the plugin since PHP index file creation is disabled.

### Changes Made:

1. **Admin Menu** (line 62-70)
   - Commented out the submenu page registration for Analytics Settings

2. **Page Rendering Function** (lines 624-746)
   - Commented out `render_analytics_settings_page()` function
   - This page allowed configuring:
     - GA4 Measurement ID
     - Analytics tracking options
     - Custom analytics code
     - Update existing tours functionality

3. **Helper Functions** (lines 748-781)
   - Commented out `get_analytics_code_preview()` function
   - Used to show preview of analytics code

4. **AJAX Handler** (lines 785-821)
   - Commented out `handle_update_tours_analytics()` function
   - Handled bulk updating of tour analytics

5. **AJAX Registration** (line 18)
   - Commented out the AJAX action for updating tours analytics

## Result

The admin menu now shows only:
- 3D Tours (main page)
- Manage Tours
- Email Settings
- Analytics (overview page)

The Analytics Settings page is no longer accessible or functional.

## Options Still Stored

The following options are still in the database but unused:
- h3tm_ga_measurement_id
- h3tm_analytics_enabled
- h3tm_track_interactions
- h3tm_track_time_spent
- h3tm_custom_analytics_code

These can be cleaned up later if needed using:
```php
delete_option('h3tm_ga_measurement_id');
delete_option('h3tm_analytics_enabled');
delete_option('h3tm_track_interactions');
delete_option('h3tm_track_time_spent');
delete_option('h3tm_custom_analytics_code');
```

## To Re-enable Later

If analytics functionality is needed in the future:
1. Uncomment all the commented sections
2. Fix the PHP index file creation issues
3. The page will be available again at: 3D Tours > Analytics Settings
