# PHP Index File Creation - DISABLED

## What Was Changed

The PHP index file creation functionality has been disabled. The plugin will now:

1. **Keep original index.html files** - No replacement with PHP files
2. **Skip analytics code injection** - Tours will use their original HTML
3. **Upload tours normally** - Just extract and use as-is

## Changes Made

### In class-h3tm-tour-manager.php:

1. **Line 95-106**: Commented out the create_php_index call after upload
   - Tours now upload successfully without PHP conversion
   
2. **Line 468-487**: Disabled update_tour_analytics function
   - Returns true immediately without processing

## Result

- Tours will upload and work normally
- Original index.html files are preserved
- No "Failed to create PHP index file" errors
- Analytics tracking would need to be added manually to tour HTML files if needed

## To Re-enable Later

If you want to re-enable PHP index creation later:
1. Uncomment the code blocks in class-h3tm-tour-manager.php
2. Fix the file permission issues that were causing the creation to fail
3. Ensure the web server can write PHP files to the tour directories

## Alternative Analytics Solution

If you need analytics without PHP files:
1. Add Google Analytics code directly to your tour HTML templates
2. Use Google Tag Manager for dynamic tracking
3. Or inject analytics via JavaScript in the theme

The tour upload functionality now works without any PHP file creation!
