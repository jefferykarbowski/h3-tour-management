### ✅ Configuration Sources Priority
1. **Environment Variables** (Highest Priority)
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `H3_S3_BUCKET` / `H3TM_S3_BUCKET`
   - `H3_S3_REGION` / `H3TM_S3_REGION`

2. **WordPress Options** (Database)
   - `h3tm_s3_bucket`
   - `h3tm_s3_region`
   - `h3tm_aws_access_key` (encrypted)
   - `h3tm_aws_secret_key` (encrypted)

3. **Environment Config Class** (If available)
   - Integrates with existing `H3TM_Environment_Config`

## Testing Protocol

### ✅ Unit Tests
Run the configuration test suite:
```bash
wp eval-file scripts/test-s3-configuration.php
```

### ✅ Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Configuration Loading
- [ ] Access admin S3 settings page
- [ ] Verify configuration status displays correctly
- [ ] Check that all configuration sources are detected

#### 2. Validation System
- [ ] Click "Validate Configuration" button
- [ ] Verify validation errors are displayed clearly
- [ ] Test with incomplete configuration (remove bucket name)
- [ ] Test with invalid bucket name format

#### 3. Debug Information
- [ ] Click "Debug Configuration" button
- [ ] Verify debug info shows all configuration sources
- [ ] Confirm no actual credentials are displayed
- [ ] Check environment variable detection

#### 4. Connection Testing
- [ ] Click "Test S3 Connection" button
- [ ] Verify connection test works with valid configuration
- [ ] Test connection failure scenarios
- [ ] Check error messages are descriptive

#### 5. AJAX Functionality
- [ ] Test presigned URL generation via AJAX
- [ ] Verify AJAX requests use fresh configuration
- [ ] Test error handling in AJAX context
- [ ] Confirm nonce verification works

## Security Verification

### ✅ Credential Protection
- [ ] Verify environment variables take precedence over database options
- [ ] Confirm database credentials are encrypted
- [ ] Check that frontend config doesn't expose credentials
- [ ] Validate debug output doesn't contain actual secrets

### ✅ Access Control
- [ ] Verify only administrators can access S3 settings
- [ ] Confirm AJAX endpoints check user capabilities
- [ ] Test nonce verification on all AJAX requests
- [ ] Validate configuration update permissions

## Performance Testing

### ✅ Caching Efficiency
- [ ] Verify configuration is cached for 1 hour
- [ ] Test validation results are cached for 30 minutes
- [ ] Confirm cache is invalidated when options change
- [ ] Check cache clearing functionality works

### ✅ Load Testing
- [ ] Test configuration loading under multiple simultaneous requests
- [ ] Verify no race conditions in singleton initialization
- [ ] Test cache performance with high request volume

## Environment-Specific Testing

### ✅ Development Environment
- [ ] Test with local development setup
- [ ] Verify debug logging is enabled
- [ ] Check SSL verification can be disabled
- [ ] Test with loose validation rules

### ✅ Staging Environment
- [ ] Test with staging-specific configuration
- [ ] Verify production-like security settings
- [ ] Test with encrypted credential storage
- [ ] Check monitoring and alerting

### ✅ Production Environment
- [ ] Verify SSL verification is enforced
- [ ] Test with environment variable configuration
- [ ] Confirm debug logging is disabled
- [ ] Test production security validations

## Migration Testing

### ✅ Existing Configuration
- [ ] Test with existing S3 configuration
- [ ] Verify existing credentials are preserved
- [ ] Check backward compatibility
- [ ] Test upgrade path from previous version

### ✅ New Installation
- [ ] Test fresh installation setup
- [ ] Verify setup wizard works correctly
- [ ] Check default configuration values
- [ ] Test initial configuration validation

## Error Scenarios

### ✅ Configuration Errors
- [ ] Missing bucket name
- [ ] Invalid bucket name format
- [ ] Missing AWS credentials
- [ ] Invalid AWS region
- [ ] Network connectivity issues

### ✅ AJAX Errors
- [ ] Invalid nonce
- [ ] Insufficient permissions
- [ ] Configuration validation failures
- [ ] S3 connection timeouts
- [ ] Malformed requests
