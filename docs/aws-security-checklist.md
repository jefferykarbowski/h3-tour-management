## Validation Commands

### AWS Configuration Validation
```bash
# Test S3 bucket access
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket/tours/ --region us-west-2

# Verify IAM permissions
aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::account:user/h3tm-s3-upload \
  --action-names s3:PutObject \
  --resource-arns arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/tours/test.zip
```

### WordPress Security Validation
```php
// Test credential encryption/decryption
$test_key = 'AKIA' . str_repeat('X', 16);
H3TM_AWS_Security::store_credentials($test_key, str_repeat('Y', 40), 'us-west-2', 'test-bucket');
$config = H3TM_AWS_Security::get_config_status();
// Verify no plaintext credentials visible

// Test presigned URL generation
$url = H3TM_AWS_Security::generate_presigned_upload_url('tours/test.zip');
// Verify URL contains no credentials
```

### Network Security Validation
```bash
# Test SSL configuration
openssl s_client -connect yoursite.com:443 -servername yoursite.com

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -I https://yoursite.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
done
```
