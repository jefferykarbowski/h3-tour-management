## Common Issues and Resolutions

### ❌ Chunked Upload Code Still Present

**Issue**: Validation finds remaining chunked upload references
**Resolution**:
1. Search codebase for `chunk`, `Chunk`, `CHUNK` patterns
2. Review `class-h3tm-admin.php`, `class-h3tm-tour-manager.php`
3. Remove or comment out chunked upload functionality
4. Update AJAX handlers to S3-only methods

### ❌ S3 Configuration Not Valid

**Issue**: S3 credentials or configuration missing/invalid
**Resolution**:
1. Set environment variables: `AWS_S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_S3_REGION`, `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY`
2. Or configure via WordPress options: `h3tm_s3_bucket`, `h3tm_s3_region`, etc.
3. Test connection with `H3TM_S3_Config_Manager->validate_configuration()`

### ⚠️ Performance Issues with Large Files

**Issue**: Memory or execution time problems with large files
**Resolution**:
1. Increase PHP `memory_limit` to 512M or higher
2. Set `max_execution_time` to 300+ seconds or 0 (unlimited)
3. Implement streaming/chunked processing for file operations
4. Consider S3 multipart upload for files >100MB

### ⚠️ Error Messages Not User-Friendly

**Issue**: Technical error messages confusing users
**Resolution**:
1. Update `H3TM_S3_Config_Manager->get_configuration_error_message()`
2. Add contextual help text in admin interface
3. Provide setup guidance and troubleshooting links
4. Implement progressive disclosure for technical details

## Validation Automation

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/s3-validation.yml
name: S3 System Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '7.4'
      - name: Install WordPress
        run: # ... WordPress setup
      - name: Run S3 Validation Suite
        run: php tests/run-s3-validation-suite.php
```

### Pre-Deployment Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-deploy.sh
echo "Running S3 validation before deployment..."
VALIDATION_SCORE=$(php tests/run-s3-validation-suite.php --score-only)

if [ $VALIDATION_SCORE -lt 85 ]; then
    echo "❌ Validation failed with score: $VALIDATION_SCORE"
    echo "Deployment blocked. Address issues and re-run validation."
    exit 1
else
    echo "✅ Validation passed with score: $VALIDATION_SCORE"
    echo "Proceeding with deployment..."
fi
```

## Extending the Validation Suite

### Adding Custom Tests

1. **Create Test Class**:
```php
class H3TM_Custom_Validator {
    public function run_custom_validation() {
        // Your validation logic
        return [
            'status' => 'PASS|FAIL|WARNING',
            'score' => 85,
            'details' => 'Test results'
        ];
    }
}
```

2. **Register with Master Runner**:
```php
// Add to run-s3-validation-suite.php
$custom_validator = new H3TM_Custom_Validator();
$custom_result = $custom_validator->run_custom_validation();
$this->validation_results['custom'] = $custom_result;
```

### Custom Validation Criteria

Override scoring weights based on your deployment priorities:
```php
$test_weights = [
    'comprehensive' => 0.4,      // Reduce if you trust code quality
    'deployment_checklist' => 0.4,  // Increase if checklist is critical
    'performance' => 0.2,        // Adjust based on performance requirements
    'custom' => 0.1             // Add custom validation weight
];
```

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```php
define('H3TM_VALIDATION_DEBUG', true);
```

### Log Files
Validation logs are written to:
- WordPress debug log: `wp-content/debug.log`
- Plugin logs: `wp-content/plugins/h3-tour-management/logs/`

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Class not found" | Missing S3 integration files | Ensure all plugin files are uploaded |
| "Memory limit exceeded" | Insufficient PHP memory | Increase memory_limit in php.ini |
| "Execution timeout" | Long-running validation | Increase max_execution_time |
| "S3 credentials invalid" | Wrong AWS credentials | Verify access key, secret, and permissions |

### Getting Help
