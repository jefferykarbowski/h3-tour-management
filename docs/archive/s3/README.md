- Common issues and resolutions

## Using This Archive

These files are preserved for historical reference. For current S3 architecture documentation, always refer to:

**[`docs/architecture/S3_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../architecture/S3_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

## Configuration Files

**Note**: The `docs/s3-configs/` directory is NOT archived as it contains actual AWS configuration files (JSON files and shell scripts) that are actively used for setup.

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these files:

```bash
# Copy back to docs/
cp docs/archive/s3/[filename].md docs/

# Add to version control if needed
git add docs/[filename].md
```

**Note**: Restoration should only be necessary for historical research, as all content is preserved in the comprehensive architecture guide.
