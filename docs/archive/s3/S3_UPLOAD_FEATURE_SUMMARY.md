# S3 Direct Upload Feature Summary

## 🚀 New Feature: S3 Direct Upload for Large Files

The H3 Tour Management plugin now supports **Amazon S3 Direct Upload** for large tour files, providing significant improvements in upload performance and reliability.

## ✨ Key Features

### **Smart Upload Routing**
- **Files ≤100MB**: Uses existing chunked upload (1MB chunks)
- **Files >100MB**: Attempts S3 Direct Upload with automatic fallback
- **Configurable threshold**: Customize the size threshold in Upload Settings

### **Seamless User Experience**
- **Automatic method selection**: No user intervention required
- **Real-time feedback**: Shows which upload method is being used
- **Progress tracking**: Enhanced progress bars with time estimates
- **Intelligent fallback**: Automatically switches to chunked upload if S3 fails

### **Visual Indicators**
- **File selection**: Shows recommended upload method based on file size
- **Progress bar**: Displays \"(S3 Direct)\" or \"(Chunked)\" during upload
- **Status messages**: Real-time updates on upload method and status
- **Large file notices**: Warns users about large files and optimization

### **Robust Error Handling**
- **Connection failures**: Falls back to chunked upload
- **Configuration errors**: Clear error messages with fallback
- **AWS SDK issues**: Graceful degradation to standard upload
- **Network timeouts**: Automatic retry with chunked method

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Enhancements**
- Dynamic AWS SDK loading (CDN-based)
- Configurable file size threshold
- Enhanced progress tracking with method indicators
- Status message system for user feedback

### **Backend Integration**
- WordPress AJAX handlers for S3 presigned URLs
- S3 file processing and cleanup
- Environment variable support for security
- Configuration validation and status checking

### **Security Features**

## 📈 Technical Specifications

### **File Processing Flow**
```
Large File Upload (>100MB):
1. Request S3 presigned URL
2. Upload directly to S3
3. Notify WordPress of completion
4. Download from S3 to WordPress
5. Process tour normally
6. Clean up S3 file
```

### **Fallback Chain**
```
S3 Direct → Chunked Upload → Error Handling
├─ Config check ├─ Standard process ├─ User feedback
├─ AWS SDK load ├─ Chunk validation ├─ Retry options
├─ Network test  ├─ Progress track  └─ Support info
└─ Upload exec   └─ Error recovery
```

### **Configuration Priority**
```
Environment Variables > Database Options > Defaults
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID    > h3tm_s3_access_key    > (not set)
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> h3tm_s3_secret_key    > (not set)
AWS_S3_BUCKET        > h3tm_s3_bucket        > (not set)
AWS_S3_REGION        > h3tm_s3_region        > us-east-1
```
