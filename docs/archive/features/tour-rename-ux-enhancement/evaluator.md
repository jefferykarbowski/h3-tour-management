- Introduces JavaScript errors or PHP fatal errors
- Performance regression for large tour operations
- Incompatible with WordPress admin interface standards
- Security vulnerabilities in AJAX handling

### Major Issues (Score < 80)
- Undefined error still occurs in some scenarios
- Progress indication missing or non-functional
- Modal dialog poor UX or accessibility issues
- Backend optimization insufficient for large tours
- Error handling incomplete or confusing

### Minor Issues (Score 80-89)
- Minor CSS inconsistencies with WordPress admin theme
- Edge case error scenarios not fully covered
- Documentation could be more comprehensive
- Testing protocol missing some scenarios

### Excellence (Score 90+)
- Perfect resolution of undefined error popup
- Professional modal dialog with validation
- Meaningful progress indication during operations
- Optimized performance for large tour directories
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Full WordPress admin integration
- Excellent documentation and testing protocols

## Specific Technical Validation

### Frontend Implementation (Specialist A)
**Must Verify**:
- **Error parsing fix**: `response.data` vs `response.data.message` handled correctly
- **Modal dialog**: Replaces prompt() with proper WordPress admin styling
- **Progress indication**: Visual feedback during AJAX operations
- **Input validation**: Prevents invalid tour names and duplicate checking
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Backend Implementation (Specialist B)
**Must Verify**:
- **Response structure**: Consistent error/success message format
- **Performance optimization**: Large directory handling improvements
- **Timeout handling**: Graceful degradation for very large operations
- **Progress reporting**: Backend support for frontend progress updates
- **Backwards compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing API

### Integration Testing Requirements
**Critical Validation Points**:
- [ ] Small tour rename (under 50 files) - smooth UX with progress
- [ ] Large tour rename (500+ files) - no timeouts, clear progress
- [ ] Error scenarios - duplicate name, permissions, disk space
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness - modal and progress work on small screens
- [ ] Accessibility - screen reader announces progress and errors
- [ ] Cross-browser - works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
