# Uploader Progress Bar Gradient Enhancement

## Task
Update the uploader progress bar so it's gradiated from red to green for better UI experience.

## Project Context
**Repository**: WordPress plugin "H3 Tour Management"
**Working directory**: C:\Users\Jeff\Documents\GitHub\h3-tour-management
**Target files**:
- `assets/js/admin.js` (lines 57-62, 97) - Progress bar creation and update logic
- `assets/css/admin.css` - CSS styling (may need new styles)

## Current Implementation
The progress bar is currently implemented with:
- Container: `#upload-progress` - static gray background
- Progress bar: `#upload-progress-bar` - solid red color (#c1272d)
- Progress updates via JavaScript: `$('#upload-progress-bar').css('width', progress + '%')`

## Technical Requirements
1. **Replace solid red** (#c1272d) with gradient from red to green
2. **Maintain visual progress indication** - user should clearly see upload progress
3. **Preserve existing functionality** - chunked upload, retry logic, error handling
4. **Responsive design** - should work across different screen sizes
5. **WordPress admin compatibility** - must integrate with existing WP admin styles

## Implementation Approaches (for specialist consideration)
**Option A**: CSS-only gradient background
- Use `linear-gradient()` or `background-image`
- Pros: Simple, performant
- Cons: Static gradient regardless of progress percentage

**Option B**: Dynamic gradient based on progress
- JavaScript calculates color interpolation based on percentage
- Pros: True red-to-green transition matching progress
- Cons: More complex, performance considerations

**Option C**: Multi-stop gradient with positioning
- CSS gradient with multiple color stops
- JavaScript adjusts `background-position` or uses mask
- Pros: Smooth transition, moderate complexity
- Cons: Browser compatibility considerations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Progress bar visually transitions from red (0%) to green (100%)
- [ ] Existing upload functionality unchanged
- [ ] No console errors or visual glitches
- [ ] Compatible with WordPress admin theme
- [ ] Clean, professional appearance

## Files to Modify
1. `assets/js/admin.js` - Update progress bar styling logic
2. `assets/css/admin.css` - Add new CSS rules for gradient
3. Potential new file: Enhanced CSS for complex gradients (if needed)

## Testing Requirements
- Test with various file sizes (small, medium, large uploads)
- Test progress at different percentages (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test error scenarios and retry functionality
- Verify existing upload success flows remain intact

## Constraints
- Must maintain WordPress coding standards
- No external dependencies (jQuery already available)
- Cross-browser compatibility required
- Performance impact should be minimal
- No breaking changes to existing upload workflow
