  - Log file size management
  - Integration with WordPress debug log

### Consistent Error Handling

  - `H3TM_Analytics`: Email scheduling and sending
  - Clear separation of responsibilities

### Created Abstractions
- **New service classes for common operations**
  - `H3TM_Security`: Security operations
  - `H3TM_Database`: Database operations
  - `H3TM_Logger`: Logging operations
  - `H3TM_Cleanup`: Maintenance operations

### Removed Duplicate Code
- **Consolidated repeated functionality**
  - Unified file operations
  - Shared validation methods
  - Common error handling patterns

## 5. WordPress Standards Compliance ✅

### WordPress Filesystem API
- **Replaced direct file operations** (`class-h3tm-tour-manager-v2.php`)
  - Uses `WP_Filesystem` for all file operations
  - Proper permission handling
  - Cross-platform compatibility

### Proper Sanitization
- **Comprehensive input sanitization**
  - `sanitize_text_field()` for text inputs
  - `sanitize_file_name()` for file names
  - `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()` for output
  - `wp_kses_post()` for rich content

### Consistent Text Domains
- **Standardized text domain usage**
  - All strings use 'h3-tour-management'
  - Proper internationalization support
  - Translation-ready

## 6. Database & Cleanup ✅

### Database Improvements
- **New database schema with proper structure**
  - User settings table with indexes
  - Analytics cache table
  - Activity log table
  - Tour metadata table
  - Email queue table

### Prepared Statements
- **All database queries use prepared statements**
  - Protection against SQL injection
  - Consistent parameter binding
  - Type-safe queries

### Orphaned File Cleanup
- **Automated cleanup service** (`class-h3tm-cleanup.php`)
  - Removes temporary upload files
  - Cleans orphaned tour directories
  - Manages log file retention
  - Database cleanup for old records
  - Scheduled via WordPress cron

## 7. Additional Enhancements

### REST API Integration
- **Added REST API endpoints**
  - `/wp-json/h3tm/v1/tours` - Get tours list
  - `/wp-json/h3tm/v1/analytics/{tour}` - Get tour analytics
  - `/wp-json/h3tm/v1/track-time` - Track user engagement

### Activity Logging
- **Comprehensive activity tracking**
  - User actions logged with context
  - IP address and user agent tracking
  - Searchable activity history

### Email Queue System
- **Reliable email delivery**
  - Queue-based processing
  - Retry mechanism for failures
  - Status tracking and reporting

### System Status Page
- **Administrative monitoring**
  - Dependency checking
