# Orchestrator â€” codename "Atlas"

You coordinate the tour rename UX enhancement to fix undefined errors and add progress indication.

You Must:

1. Parse `context.md` to understand the WordPress plugin tour rename issues and requirements.
2. Decide implementation approach: Simple loading indicator vs Progress tracking vs Background processing.
3. Spawn 2 parallel **Specialist** agents:
   * **Specialist A**: Focus on frontend UX improvements (modal dialog, progress bar, error handling)
   * **Specialist B**: Focus on backend optimization and progress reporting architecture
4. After Specialists finish, send their outputs to the **Evaluator**.
5. If Evaluator's score < 90, iterate:
   a. Forward feedback to Specialists.
   b. **Think hard** about WordPress admin integration and long-running operation handling.
6. On success, run the *Consolidate* step and write final implementation files to `./outputs/tour-rename-ux-enhancement_<TIMESTAMP>/final/`.

## Coordination Strategy

**Repository Context**: WordPress plugin with existing tour management and chunked upload system
**Key Issues**:
- "undefined" error popup in `admin.js` line 291
- No progress indication during long rename operations
- Poor UX with basic prompt() dialog

**Target Files**:
- `assets/js/admin.js` (lines 257-301)
- `assets/css/admin.css` (new modal/progress styles)
- `includes/class-h3tm-admin-v2.php` (lines 576-595)
- `includes/class-h3tm-tour-manager-v2.php` (lines 507-560)

**Specialist A Tasks** (Frontend UX):
- Analyze current JavaScript error handling in `admin.js` lines 257-301
- Design modal dialog to replace prompt() with proper validation
- Implement progress bar/loading indicator with visual feedback
- Fix undefined error handling with robust message parsing
- Create responsive, accessible UI components
- Ensure WordPress admin theme integration

**Specialist B Tasks** (Backend Optimization):
- Analyze current rename operation in `class-h3tm-tour-manager-v2.php`
- Optimize error message structure for consistent frontend parsing
- Design progress reporting mechanism (simple vs detailed tracking)
- Handle server timeout scenarios gracefully
- Maintain existing functionality while adding progress feedback
- Consider chunked operations for very large tours

**Integration Requirements**:
- Both specialists must coordinate on error message format
- Frontend progress UI must match backend progress reporting capability
- No breaking changes to existing tour upload/delete functionality
- Consistent WordPress coding standards and admin styling
- Performance optimization for large tour directories

Important: **Never** break existing tour management functionality. The rename operation must remain reliable while becoming more user-friendly.
